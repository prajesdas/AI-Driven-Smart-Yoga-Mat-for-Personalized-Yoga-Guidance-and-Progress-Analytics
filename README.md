# 🧘‍♂️ AI-Driven Smart Yoga Mat for Personalized Yoga Guidance and Progress Analytics
 Project Title

A Smart Yoga Mat integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities to support smart watch integration for tracking progress and provide curated yoga content by experts, while ensuring its affordability

##  Abstract

The Smart Yoga Mat is an innovative fusion of artificial intelligence and wellness technology designed to enhance yoga practice through real-time posture correction, personalized guidance, and holistic fitness tracking. Embedded sensors and camera-based pose estimation capture user movements, while AI analyzes posture, balance, and alignment to deliver instant feedback.

By integrating with smart watches, the system tracks heart rate, calories burned, and activity levels, providing a comprehensive view of the user’s wellness journey. Additionally, curated yoga content from expert instructors is dynamically recommended based on user skill level, goals, and past performance.

Affordability is a key design principle, achieved through cost-effective hardware, scalable software, and leveraging existing wearable devices. The Smart Yoga Mat democratizes access to expert-level yoga guidance, making safe, effective, and personalized yoga practice accessible to everyone.

## Problem Statement

Yoga offers significant physical and mental health benefits, but incorrect posture, lack of expert supervision, and inconsistent practice can reduce effectiveness and cause injury. Traditional yoga mats provide no feedback, while online classes lack real-time correction. Personal instructors, though effective, are expensive and inaccessible to many.

Existing smart fitness solutions are often fragmented, costly, or require multiple devices, limiting adoption. There is a strong need for a unified, intelligent, and affordable system that delivers real-time feedback, adaptive training, and progress tracking without constant human supervision.

Proposed Solution – SOIMat

SOIMat is an AI-powered Smart Yoga Mat designed to enhance yoga practice through real-time posture correction, personalized sessions, and smartwatch-based biometric tracking. The system focuses on accessibility, affordability, and intelligent automation to deliver expert-level guidance at home.

Embedded Sensors & Camera
Monitor posture, balance, pressure distribution, and body alignment.

AI-Powered Guidance
Provides real-time corrections and personalized yoga routines.

Voice Interaction Module
Supports voice commands and audio feedback.

Smart Watch Integration
Collects biometric data such as heart rate and calorie expenditure.

Cost-Effective Design
Uses existing wearables and scalable software to reduce cost.
